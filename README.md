## Highlights

- Unlimited plugin composition with no architectural restrictions
- Performant language-agnostic plugin system
- Component Model async functions

NOTE: Cross-plugin support for `future`, `stream`, `error-context`, and threads is waiting for Wasmtime's implementations to be ready.

## Project Philosophy

- **Single tool, single task:** Apps should be broken up into small chunks that are meant to be composed together to create a whole.
- **Build around your workflow, not services:** Everything **you** use for a single task should be working together instead of you trying to duct-tape it together yourself.
- **The client belongs to the user:** Any part should be able to be easily added, removed or switched out for something else.
- **Zero-trust by default:** Don't just use something and expect it behaves, assume malice and constrain it to the minimum capabilities required.

## Quick Start

```rust
use std::collections::{ HashMap, HashSet };
use wasm_link::{
	Binding, Interface, Function, FunctionKind, ReturnKind,
	Plugin, PluginContext, Engine, Component, Linker, ResourceTable, Val,
};
use wasm_link::cardinality::ExactlyOne ;

// First, declare a plugin context, the data stored inside wasmtime `Store<T>`.
// It must contain a resource table to implement `PluginContext` which is needed
// for ownership tracking of wasm component model resources.
struct Context { resource_table: ResourceTable }

impl PluginContext for Context {
	fn resource_table( &mut self ) -> &mut ResourceTable {
		&mut self.resource_table
	}
}

// You create your own engine. This allows you to define your config but note that
// not all options are compatible. As a general rule of thumb, if an option changes
// the way you interact with wasm, it is likely not compatible since this is managed
// by `wasm_link` directly. If the option makes sense, it will likely be supported
// in the future through wasm_link options.
let engine = Engine::default();

// Similarly you may create your own linker, which you can add any exports into.
// Such exports will be available to all the plugins. It is your responsibility to
// make sure these don't conflict with re-exports of plugins that some other plugin
// depends on as these too have to be added to the same linker.
let linker = Linker::new( &engine );

// Build the DAG bottom-up: start with plugins that have no dependencies.
// Note that for plugins that don't require linking, you only need to pass in
// a reference to a linker. For plugins that have dependencies, the linker is mutated.
// Plugin IDs are specified in the cardinality wrapper to prevent duplicate ids.
let leaf = Plugin::new(
	Component::new( &engine, "(component)" )?,
	Context { resource_table: ResourceTable::new() },
).instantiate( &engine, &linker )?;

// Bindings expose a plugin's exports to other plugins.
// Wrapper sets cardinality: ExactlyOne, AtMostOne (0-1), AtLeastOne (1+), Any (0+).
let leaf_binding = Binding::new(
	"empty:package",
	HashMap::new(),
	ExactlyOne( "leaf".to_string(), leaf ),
);

// `link()` wires up dependencies - this plugin can now import from leaf_binding.
let root = Plugin::new(
	Component::new( &engine, r#"(component
		(core module $m (func (export "f") (result i32) i32.const 42))
		(core instance $i (instantiate $m))
		(func $f (export "get-value") (result u32) (canon lift (core func $i "f")))
		(instance $inst (export "get-value" (func $f)))
		(export "my:package/example" (instance $inst))
	)"# )?,
	Context { resource_table: ResourceTable::new() },
).link( &engine, linker, vec![ leaf_binding ])?;

// Interface tells `wasm_link` which functions exist and how to handle returns.
let root_binding = Binding::new(
	"my:package",
	HashMap::from([( "example".to_string(), Interface::new(
		HashMap::from([( "get-value".into(), Function::new(
			FunctionKind::Freestanding,
			ReturnKind::MayContainResources,
		))]),
		HashSet::new(),
	))]),
	ExactlyOne( "root".to_string(), root ),
);

// Now you can call into the plugin graph from the host.
let result = root_binding.dispatch( "example", "get-value", &[ /* args */ ] )?;
match result {
	ExactlyOne( _id, Ok( Val::U32( n ))) => assert_eq!( n, 42 ),
	ExactlyOne( _id, Ok( _ )) => panic!( "unexpected response" ),
	ExactlyOne( _id, Err( err )) => panic!( "dispatch error: {}", err ),
}
```

## Plugin Error ABI

The versioned [`wasm-link:runtime`](wit/wasm-link.wit) WIT package defines the
dispatch errors exposed to WebAssembly plugins. It is included in the published
crate so plugin bindings can be generated from the same contract used by the
runtime's ABI tests.

Asynchronous destinations use caller-aware round-robin dispatch. Each linked
plugin has one opaque caller identity shared by all of its sockets, so a busy
caller moves behind other callers after every completed call. Outstanding work
is rejected with `dispatch-queue-full` above 1,024 calls or 64 MiB per caller,
or above 4,096 calls or 256 MiB per destination. Synchronous destinations use a
FIFO admission gate, so independent callers wait instead of receiving a timing-
dependent `lock-rejected` error. A same-thread re-entrant cycle is still rejected.

## Goals

- ✅ Basic plugin linking
- ✅ Component model support
- ✅ Resource support
- ✅ Fuel, epoch, and memory resource limits
- ✅ Component Model async functions
- ⬛ Component Model threads

Further goals are yet to be determined.

### Development Setup

#### Using Nix (Recommended)

If you have Nix installed, please use the provided `flake.nix` to set up everything you need:

```bash
nix develop
```

#### Manual Setup

You should most likely be fine with just the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started/)
