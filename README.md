## Highlights

- Unlimited plugin composition with no architectural restrictions
- Performant language-agnostic plugin system

NOTE: Async types (`Future`, `Stream`, `ErrorContext`) are not yet supported for cross-plugin transfer and will return an error if encountered.

## Project Philosophy

- **Single tool, single task:** Apps should be broken up into small chunks that are meant to be composed together to create a whole.
- **Build around your workflow, not services:** Everything **you** use for a single task should be working together instead of you trying to duct-tape it together yourself.
- **The client belongs to the user:** Any part should be able to be easily added, removed or switched out for something else.
- **Zero-trust by default:** Don't just use something and expect it behaves, assume malice and constrain it to the minimum capabilities required.

## Quick Start

```rust
use std::collections::{ HashMap, HashSet };
use wasm_link::{
    Binding, Interface, Function, FunctionKind, ReturnKind,
    Plugin, PluginContext, ExactlyOne,
    Engine, Component, Linker, ResourceTable, Val,
};

// First, declare a plugin context, the data stored inside wasmtime `Store<T>`.
// It must contain a resource table to implement `PluginContext` which is needed
// for ownership tracking of wasm component model resources.
struct Context { resource_table: ResourceTable }

impl PluginContext for Context {
    fn resource_table( &mut self ) -> &mut ResourceTable {
        &mut self.resource_table
    }
}

// You create your own engine. This allows you to define your config but note that
// not all options are compatible. As a general rule of thumb, if an option changes
// the way you interact with wasm, it is likely not compatible since this is managed
// by `wasm_link` directly. If the option makes sense, it will likely be supported
// in the future through wasm_link options.
let engine = Engine::default();

// Similarly you may create your own linker, which you can add any exports into.
// Such exports will be available to all the plugins. It is your responsibility to
// make sure these don't conflict with re-exports of plugins that some other plugin
// depends on as these too have to be added to the same linker.
let linker = Linker::new( &engine );

// Build the DAG bottom-up: start with plugins that have no dependencies.
// Note that for plugins that don't require linking, you only need to pass in
// a reference to a linker. For plugins that have dependencies, the linker is mutated.
// Plugin IDs are specified in the cardinality wrapper to prevent duplicate ids.
let leaf = Plugin::new(
    Component::new( &engine, "(component)" )?,
    Context { resource_table: ResourceTable::new() },
).instantiate( &engine, &linker )?;

// Bindings expose a plugin's exports to other plugins.
// Wrapper sets cardinality: ExactlyOne, AtMostOne (0-1), AtLeastOne (1+), Any (0+).
let leaf_binding = Binding::new(
    "empty:package",
    HashMap::new(),
    ExactlyOne( "leaf".to_string(), leaf ),
);

// `link()` wires up dependencies - this plugin can now import from leaf_binding.
let root = Plugin::new(
    Component::new( &engine, r#"(component
        (core module $m (func (export "f") (result i32) i32.const 42))
        (core instance $i (instantiate $m))
        (func $f (export "get-value") (result u32) (canon lift (core func $i "f")))
        (instance $inst (export "get-value" (func $f)))
        (export "my:package/example" (instance $inst))
    )"# )?,
    Context { resource_table: ResourceTable::new() },
).link( &engine, linker, vec![ leaf_binding ])?;

// Interface tells `wasm_link` which functions exist and how to handle returns.
let root_binding = Binding::new(
    "my:package",
    HashMap::from([( "example".to_string(), Interface::new(
        HashMap::from([( "get-value".into(), Function::new(
            FunctionKind::Freestanding,
            ReturnKind::MayContainResources,
        ))]),
        HashSet::new(),
    ))]),
    ExactlyOne( "root".to_string(), root ),
);

// Now you can call into the plugin graph from the host.
let result = root_binding.dispatch( "example", "get-value", &[ /* args */ ] )?;
match result {
    ExactlyOne( _id, Ok( Val::U32( n ))) => assert_eq!( n, 42 ),
    ExactlyOne( _id, Ok( _ )) => panic!( "unexpected response" ),
    ExactlyOne( _id, Err( err )) => panic!( "dispatch error: {}", err ),
}
```

## Goals

- ✅ Basic plugin linking
- ✅ Component model support
- ✅ Resource support
- ✅ Fuel, epoch, and memory resource limits
- ⬛ Async, streams and threads

Further goals are yet to be determined.

### Development Setup

#### Using Nix (Recommended)

If you have Nix installed, please use the provided `flake.nix` to set up everything you need:

```bash
nix develop
```

#### Manual Setup

You should most likely be fine with just the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started/)
